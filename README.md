DS_Store Begone (Java Version)
========================

I decided to port my first program over to java to further hone my skills as a programmer.

This program removes all .DS_Store and other trash files from a selected drive.

The exact files and folders removed from the drive are:
-   The ``.fseventsd`` folder.
-   The ``.Trashes`` folder.
-   The ``.Spotlight-V100`` folder.
-   Files beginning with ``._`` For example, ``._MUSICASSIGNMENT.docx``
-   Files named ``.DS_Store``.
